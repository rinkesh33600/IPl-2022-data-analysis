# IPL DATA ANALYSIS

## Problem Statement

This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset spanning from the inaugural season in 2008 to the latest season in 2022. The analysis focuses on exploring various aspects of IPL matches, including team performances across seasons, venue-wise statistics, player Statistics, and more. The project utilizes Power BI for data visualization and exploration, providing interactive dashboards and detailed insights into IPL trends over the years.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : Their were two tables on which we have to make the relationship to connect them[ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022] and [ipl_matches_2008_2022]

- Step 5 : Creating another table for year and date. 
- Step 6 : Connecting all the three table to establish relationship between them.

- Step 7 : Cleaning the data through the power query. 
- Step 8 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added and many pics were inserted.
- Step 9 : Few card visuals were introduced and few measures were created.

           
           Creating a detailed GitHub project description for an IPL dataset analysis using Power BI involves outlining the project's objectives, the dataset's scope, methodologies used, visualizations created, and insights derived. Here's a comprehensive example of what you could include:

4. Seasonal Trends: Identify patterns and trends across different IPL seasons.

### Methodology
- Data Cleaning and Preparation: Processed the raw dataset to ensure consistency and reliability, handling missing values and inconsistencies where necessary.
  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized Power BI's capabilities to perform EDA, gaining initial insights into the dataset's structure and key variables.
  
- Data Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards and visualizations using Power BI, presenting key findings in a clear and insightful manner.
  
- Statistical Analysis: Applied statistical techniques to validate findings and draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

### Key Visualizations
- Team Performance Over Time: Line charts showing each team's win-loss record across IPL seasons.
  
- Venue Analysis: Maps and bar charts illustrating win percentages of teams at different IPL venues.
  
- Player Contribution Metrics: Tables and graphs highlighting top players based on runs scored, wickets taken, and other metrics.

### Insights
1. Venue Impact: Certain venues show a clear advantage for specific teams, influencing their overall performance in IPL matches.
   
2. Seasonal Variations: Teams exhibit varying levels of success across different seasons, influenced by factors such as player form, injuries, and strategic changes.
   
3. Player Influence: Analysis reveals key players whose performances significantly impact their team's chances of winning matches.

### Conclusion
This project provides a deep dive into the IPL dataset using Power BI, offering valuable insights into team performances, venue dynamics, and player contributions over the league's history. The interactive dashboards and visualizations allow stakeholders to explore and understand the data comprehensively, supporting informed decision-making and further research in the realm of cricket analytics.

### Future Work
- Predictive Modeling: Implement machine learning models to forecast match outcomes based on historical data.
  
- Advanced Analytics: Incorporate advanced statistical techniques to uncover hidden patterns and correlations within the dataset.
  
- Expand Dataset: Continuously update the dataset with new IPL seasons and additional data sources for more comprehensive analysis.
